From http://osxdaily.com/2012/05/25/how-to-set-up-a-password-less-ssh-login/

1)On local machine, generate a secure SSH key:

ssh-keygen

2) Walk through the key generator and set a password, the key file by default goes into ~/.ssh/id_rsa 

3) Copy the generated key to the remote server you want to setup passwordless logins with:

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@remotehost 'cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'

This command takes the generated SSH key from the local machine, connects to the 
remote host via SSH, and then uses cat to append the key file to the remote users authorized key list. 
Because this connects with SSH to the remote machine you will need to enter the password to use this command.

4)Finally, confirm that you can now login to the remote SSH server without a password:

ssh user@remotehost.com
